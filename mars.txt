Mars - also know as the red planets - is the 4th planet from the sun

Now I can add another line
And even a third file!

It has the largest volcano in the solar system

It also has Polar Ice caps, which is much more exciting than volcanoes!
But it's a REALLY BIG volcano - Olympus Mons < Ice Caps.

We may never land a rover there again

Mars is rather dry
